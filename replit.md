### Database Structure
The application uses SQLite with multiple tables including:
- `users`: User authentication and roles
- `projects`: Project and quotation data
- `register_project`: Project pipeline tracking
- `engineers`: Engineer registration and details
- `rfq_requests`: RFQ tracking
- `vendors`, `distributors`, `contractors`, `consultants`, `end_users`: CRM entities
- `tasks`: Task management system

### Directory Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application (5066 lines)
- `templates/`: HTML templates
- `Static/` (symlinked as `static/`): Static assets (images, CSS, JS)
- `uploads/`: User-uploaded files (cost sheets, documents)
- `ProjectStatus.db`: SQLite database

## Configuration

### Development
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (configurable via HOST environment variable)
- Port: 5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- Debug mode: Controlled by FLASK_DEBUG environment variable (1=enabled, 0=disabled)

### Deployment
- Target: Autoscale (stateless)
- Command: `python3 app.py`
- The application respects Replit's PORT environment variable for proper deployment

## User Preferences
- **Email Provider**: Resend (configured with API key, not using Replit integration)
- **Note**: User declined Replit's Resend integration, using manual secret configuration instead

## Security Improvements

‚úÖ **The following security improvements have been implemented:**

1. **Secret Key Security** (FIXED):
   - Changed from hard-coded 'your_secret_key' to environment-based configuration
   - Implementation: `app.secret_key = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', os.urandom(24).hex())`
   - Uses random generation as fallback if SECRET_KEY environment variable not set
   - For production deployment, set a strong SECRET_KEY environment variable

2. **Password Hashing** (FIXED):
   - Implemented werkzeug.security password hashing throughout the application
   - New passwords are hashed using `generate_password_hash()` before storage
   - Login verification uses `check_password_hash()` for secure comparison
   - **Password Migration**: Automatic upgrade system for existing plaintext passwords
     - Legacy plaintext passwords are detected and validated on login
     - Upon successful login, plaintext passwords are automatically upgraded to hashed format
     - Both users and engineers tables are updated simultaneously
     - No user intervention required - migration happens transparently

3. **Database Security** (PARTIAL):
   - SQLite database file still not encrypted at rest
   - **RECOMMENDED for Production**: Migrate to Replit PostgreSQL with proper access controls
   - Contact information stored in database should be considered sensitive

## Technical Notes
- Static folder case sensitivity resolved with symbolic link (Static -> static)
- All database tables properly initialized with complete schema
- Password migration system handles legacy accounts automatically
- LSP diagnostics about imports are cosmetic (all imports resolve correctly at runtime)
