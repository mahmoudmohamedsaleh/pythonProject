# CRM and Presales Monitoring System

## Overview
This Flask-based CRM and Presales Monitoring System tracks projects, quotations, RFQs, and sales performance, managing the entire sales pipeline from lead generation to project completion. It provides comprehensive features for user authentication, project and customer relationship management, sales and presales tools, and analytics. The system supports a public registration process with admin approval and integrates robust password security, including an admin-assisted password reset mechanism.

### UI/UX Improvements âœ… (2025-10-30)
- **Removed manual Deal Value field** from Register New Project and Edit Project forms
- **Auto-calculated deal values**: System now automatically calculates from quotations via AI
- **Added Delete Project button** in pipeline view (admin-only access)
- **Admin-only delete**: Only General Managers and Technical Team Leaders can delete projects
- **Confirmation prompt**: JavaScript confirmation before deletion to prevent accidents

### AI-Powered Deal Value Calculator âœ… ðŸ¤–
- **Intelligent quote revision detection** using regex pattern matching
- **Automatic deal value calculation** from quotation selling prices
- **Smart duplicate prevention**: only counts latest revision of each quote
- **System-based filtering**: prevents counting multiple quotes for same system
- **ENHANCED: Intelligent quote-to-project matching** - Prioritizes quoted text in project names
  - Example: "Qalam School 'Wadi'" now correctly includes only Wadi quotes, not Qalam quotes
  - Uses 13 identifier mappings (SchlQlmâ†’Qalam, SchlWadiâ†’Wadi, etc.)
- **Admin interface** at `/admin/update_deal_values` for bulk updates
- **API endpoint** at `/api/calculate_deal_value/<project_name>` for programmatic access
- **Delete route**: `/delete_project/<project_id>` (POST, admin-only)
- **Multi-layered AI logic**:
  1. Parse quote references to extract base and revision number
  2. Match quotes to projects using intelligent identifier detection
  3. Group quotes by base reference
  4. Select highest revision number + most recent date
  5. Filter duplicates by system type
  6. Sum quotation_selling_price for accurate deal value
- **Safety features**: Preview before commit, transaction-based updates, admin-only access
- **Comprehensive documentation**: AI_DEAL_VALUE_CALCULATOR.md created

## User Preferences

- **Note**: User declined Replit's Resend integration, using manual secret configuration instead

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a comprehensive admin access control UI at `/access_control` for managing granular page-level permissions. It also includes an admin OTP Dashboard at `/pending_otp_requests` for assisting with password resets without email. The UI provides real-time permission updates via AJAX and visual indicators for permission sources. Dynamic UI elements are supported through `user_has_permission()` in templates.

### Technical Implementations
- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, openpyxl, xlsxwriter
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with Jinja2
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control (e.g., General Manager, Technical Team Leader, Presale Engineer, Sales Engineer) with `werkzeug.security` for password hashing (scrypt:32768:8:1). Includes login/logout, session management, and a comprehensive page-level permission system. All routes are protected by `@login_required` or `@permission_required`.
- **Password Management**: Implements secure password hashing with automatic migration for plaintext passwords. Supports two password reset methods: OTP via email (if domain verified) and an admin-assisted manual OTP distribution dashboard. An admin-only direct password reset feature is also available.
- **Registration**: Public registration page with admin approval workflow.
- **Project Management**: Features project registration, quotation submission, status updates, and tracking through multiple stages.
- **CRM Features**: Manages customers, vendors, distributors, contractors, consultants, end-users, and technical support requests.
- **Sales & Presales Tools**: RFQ management, quotation builder, solution builder (Fiber, Passive), and cost sheet management.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Sales and presales performance dashboards, pipeline analysis, and aging reports.
- **Document Management**: File upload/download for quotations and cost sheets, with Excel export functionality.
- **Product Catalog**: Includes fire alarm, CCTV, and passive products.

### Feature Specifications
- **Granular Access Control**: A page-level permission system with three database tables (`permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_permissions`) allows for role-based defaults and user-specific overrides (Allow, Deny, Inherit). Permissions are cached in sessions and refreshed upon changes.
- **Admin-Assisted Password Reset**: A dashboard displays active OTP requests for administrators to manually provide OTPs to users, especially useful when email services are not fully configured. OTPs expire after 15 minutes and are single-use.
- **Public Registration with Admin Approval**: New users can register and their accounts require approval from General Managers or Technical Team Leaders.
- **User Management System**: An admin panel allows General Managers and Technical Team Leaders to add, edit, or delete user accounts, reset passwords, and assign roles.

### System Design Choices
- The application uses environment variables for configuration (e.g., `HOST`, `PORT`, `FLASK_DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, email provider settings).
- A robust security architecture with complete route protection ensures all sensitive data and functions require authentication and authorization.
- Automatic password migration handles legacy plaintext passwords by upgrading them to hashed format upon first login.
- Multi-source email lookup for password resets checks `users`, `registration_requests`, and `engineers` tables.
- All 24 protected routes enforce server-side permissions.

## External Dependencies
- **Email Service**: Resend API (used for OTP via email, manual configuration without Replit's built-in integration).
- **Database**: SQLite3 (for application data).
